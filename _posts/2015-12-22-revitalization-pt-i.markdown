This morning I really didn't <b>feel like going to work</b>. Last night I had been vegging out with my girlfriend wondering why I couldn't spend more of my waking hours doing just that. I spend 40 -50 hours of the week doing things... just doing things that <i>appear</i> to matter to my manager, who then in turn does something that <i>appears</i> to matter to his manager.  I imagine that at some level someone does nothing at all, and is completely satisfied. 

There's a new <a href="http://www.inc.com/the-build-network/why-paid-sabbaticals-are-good-for-employees-and-employers.html">trend</a> that seems to be gaining momentum that seems appealing: maybe people get burnt out from maximizing their work-weeks?
